                    <h2>Proper skin care is important because our skin is the largest barrier against infection that
                        we have. Keeping our skin healthy and moist helps keep this barrier strong. When the skin gets
                        dry or irritated by harsh soaps, cracks in the skin can occur. Cracks in the skin make a person
                        more prone to infection. Skincare products should be free of scents or perfumes. Soaps should be
                        gentle and moisturizers should be used daily.

                    <h3>THE ORDINARY</h3>
                    <h3>100% PLANT DERIVED SQUALIN</h3>
                    <h2>If you guys have been following my youtube, you must know that i struggled with my hyper oily
                        skin. This product changed the game!
                        It is a lightweight plant-derived solution that supports healthy hydration.
                        Squalane has very high emollience, is an exceptional hydrator and can prevent ongoing loss of
                        hydration that impairs dermal suppleness.

                        I've for so long been of the camp that The Ordinary simply cannot be as good as its expensive
                        counterparts due to its cheap cost. I'm a fool and a slave to marketing! I'm all wrong! There is
                        absolutely no discernible difference between this and expensive brands of oils. This squalane
                        performs the same. Stop wasting your money, this is just as good.
                        I highly recommend, does NOT leave skin oily/greasy. It absorbs right into the skin. It leaves
                        my skin feeling super hydrated and glows!

                        This alcohol-free tonic is never tested on animals.
                        This is one of those staple products in my routine that I will NEVER go without. I prefer to buy
                        the big 500ml bottle when they are available but I missed the last two times it was available,
                        so instead I just keep buying the 250ml bottle when I get about 1/2 way done with my 500ml and
                        just refill it (lol I like the pump option SO much better). It makes my skin glow & look so
                        healthy!!! I use it every morning when I wake up after I wash my face. I’ve been using Glow
                        Tonic daily for the last year and half & my skin has NEVER been better. Literally I can not go
                        without.

                    <h2>Skin is an important factor for self-confidence. When we look good, we feel good. And our skin
                        is a big part of our appearance. That’s why skin care is so important: it makes you look good,
                        it keeps your skin healthy, and you will feel good.How your skin will look in ten or twenty
                        years, depends on the way you care for it now
                        So make sure to take good care, but also to not use skin care products that might do more bad
                        than good. Use products that are made for your skin type, and never use anything too aggressive.
                        I'm here to help you give some advice on some products that works for me.

                    <h3>LUSH</h3>
                    <h3>OCEAN SALT BODY SCRUB</h3>
                    <h2>
                        Refreshing, exfoliating, hydrating...what doesn't this scrub do? Our cult classic scrub has a
                        mineral-rich mix of fine and coarse sea salt for serious exfoliation, balanced with coconut oil
                        and avocado butter to soften the skin. That punchy citrus scent? It comes from lime oil as well
                        as limes extracted in vodka to brighten and tone. Just one scrub with this beauty and you'll see
                        why it's so popular!
                        I was hesitant to buy this because of the mixed reviews. I had the chance to get a sample of it
                        and WOW! It leaves your skin very soft and I can see why people complain about the oily-ness but
                        if your face needs the moister go for it! have very dry skin under my nose and 4 uses of this
                        scrub and it has gotten so much better! I have looked for a product to get rid of the dryness
                        and I finally found it. The smell is great too!

                    <h2>
                        Enjoy Geranium Leaf Body Cleanser and Geranium Leaf Body Balm in concert daily to maintain
                        impeccably cleansed and supple skin.
                        The AESOP Geranium Leaf Duet comes from the brand’s popular line of parsley seed based products
                        and works best for those with normal to sensitive skin. This AESOP body balm is a lotion that
                        provides gentle exfoliation while deep cleaning the skin. Along with parsley seed, this AESOP
                        lotion is infused with lactic acid which is an alpha hydroxy acid known for helping to exfoliate
                        the skin, licorice root which helps to brighten the complexion, and black currant seed oil which
                        helps stimulate skin cell regeneration. After using this product, my skin feels cleaner and
                        smoother!

                        The smallest amount goes a long way so all you need is a teaspoon. Use twice daily and blend the
                        mixture with a few drops of water to form a milky emulsion, which should then be massaged over
                        your damp dace and rinsed off thoroughly.
